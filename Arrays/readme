see the approaches of 
1.largest array element
2,kth largest element
3.maximum difference between indexes
4.leader problem
5.stock buy sell
6.arrayrotation to k times
7.maximum subarray sum and concecutive even odd array :(both are depenedent upon kadan's algorithm)
8.majority element(this is based on moore's boording algorithm)
9.minimumflip ki approach bhi dekhna
